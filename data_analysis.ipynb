Now, consider the general equation of all lines that belong to $\\mathcal{F}$. Let $P$ be located at $(a, 0)$ and $Q$ be located at $(0, b)$. With these assumptions, we may arrive at the equation $ay + bx = ab$. However, a critical condition that must be satisfied by our parameters is that $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, since the length of $\\overline{PQ} = 1$. We wish to find a point $C$ on $\\overline{AB}$ such that $\\overline{PQ}$ passes through $C$ if and only if $a = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the property $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ implies that if $a = \\frac{1}{2}$, then $\\overline{PQ} = \\overline{AB}$, we now proceed by finding the intersection of two lines: \n",

       "-a^4 + 2xa^3 + (-4x^2 + 3x + \\frac{1}{4})a^2 - 2xa + x^2 = 0.\n",
       "Note that $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to this polynomial. Perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution $a = \\frac{1}{2}$. This yields: \n",
       "-a^3 + (2x - \\frac{1}{2})a^2 + (-4x^2 + 4x)a - 2x^2 = 0.\n",
       "We then plug in $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ to find the corresponding values of $x$. This results in the quadratic equation: \n",
       "16x^2 - 10x + 1 = 0.\n",
       "This is easily factored to give $x = \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to a point already covered by the horizontal line segment, we discard it. Thus, $x = \\frac{1}{8}$ is the only valid solution.\n",
       "Now, we substitute $x = \\frac{1}{8}$ into the equation of line $\\overline{AB}$: $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which gives $y = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}$.\n",
       "The distance from the origin is then given by $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{8^2} + \\left( \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{16}}$. Squaring this distance gives $\\frac{7}{16}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{23}$."

In our case, $A$ represents the probability of winning the grand prize, and $B$ represents the probability of winning a prize. Clearly, $P(B|A)=1$, since by winning the grand prize you automatically win a prize. Thus, we want to find $\\dfrac{P(A)}{P(B)}$.\n",

Let Jen choose the numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$; we have $\\dbinom42$ ways to choose which $2$ of these $4$ numbers are identical to the lottery. We have now determined $2$ of the $4$ numbers drawn in the lottery; since the other $2$ numbers Jen chose can not be chosen by the lottery, the lottery now has $10-2-2=6$ numbers to choose the last $2$ numbers from. Thus, this case is $\\dbinom62$, so this case yields $\\dbinom42\\dbinom62=6\\cdot15=90$ possibilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next, let us calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $3$ identical numbers to the lottery. Again, let Jen choose $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. This time, we have $\\dbinom43$ ways to choose the identical numbers and again $6$ numbers left for the lottery to choose from; however, since $3$ of the lottery's numbers have already been determined, the lottery only needs to choose $1$ more number, so this is $\\dbinom61$. This case yields $\\dbinom43\\dbinom61=4\\cdot6=24$.\n",

       "Finally, let us calculate the number of ways to all $4$ numbers matching. There is actually just one way for this to happen.\n",
       "\n",
       "In total, we have $90+24+1=115$ ways to win a prize. The lottery has $\\dbinom{10}4=210$ possible combinations to draw, so the probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. There is actually no need to simplify it or even evaluate $\\dbinom{10}4$ or actually even know that it has to be $\\dbinom{10}4$; it suffices to call it $a$ or some other variable, as it will cancel out later. However, let us just go through with this. The probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. Note that the probability of winning a grand prize is just matching all $4$ numbers, which we already calculated to have $1$ possibility and thus have probability $\\dfrac1{210}$. Thus, our answer is $\\dfrac{\\frac1{210}}{\\frac{115}{210}}=\\dfrac1{115}$. Therefore, our answer is $1+115=\\boxed{116}$."
